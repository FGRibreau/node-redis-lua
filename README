Patch redis script commands into node-redis prototype. Does not assume node-redis
has been patched with scripting support so can use the standard version.

Requires:
	https://github.com/mranney/node_redis
	coffescript (optional - compile js included)
	Redis scripting branch, https://github.com/antirez/redis/tree/scripting

Installation. Not in npm repo yet so install from github source.

    git clone https://github.com/shirro/node_redis_lua.git redis-lua
    cd redis-lua
    npm install redis
    npm install .

To use require lua:

    redis = require('redis')
    require('redis-lua').attachLua(redis)

Add some redis scripts:

    redis.lua 'myset', 2, 'return redis.call("set", KEYS[1], KEYS[2])'

And call like a regular redis command:

    r = redis.createClient()
    r.myset 'testing', 'surprise', redis.print

The lua script is passed by eval first time and evalsha subsequently
with fallback to eval.
